# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique used in ancient Rome, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to communicate with his officials. It involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specific number of positions. This Python script allows users to encode and decode messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.

## Features

- **Encoding**: Shifts the letters in the input text forward by the specified number of positions.
- **Decoding**: Shifts the letters in the input text backward by the specified number of positions.
- **Handling non-alphabet characters**: The script leaves spaces, numbers, and special characters unchanged.

## How to Run

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**:
   Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
